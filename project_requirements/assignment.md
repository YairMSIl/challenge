# Multi-Service Chatbot Implementation Challenge
## Background
You are given a budget of 25$ to implement a Python-based chatbot that provides users with
three distinct services: image generation, music generation, and research maker. Your
implementation should demonstrate your ability to work with external APIs, handle user
interactions.
## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Create a chatbot that can understand and respond to user requests for:
- Images (e.g., "make me a picture of a sunset")
- Songs (e.g., "I want a song about the rain)
- Research papers (e.g., "write me a research on OpenAi")

### Budget Constraints
- You have X$ to spend on API calls
- Implement a cost tracking mechanism

## Deliverables
1. Source code
2. README.md with:
- Setup instructions

- Usage examples
3. Requirements.txt or equivalent dependency management
4. Brief technical documentation explaining your design decisions

## Evaluation Criteria
You will be evaluated on:
1. Code quality and organization
2. API integration implementation
3. Documentation quality
4. Overall user experience

## Time Limit
- Complete this assignment within 3 days of receiving it
- Communicate early if you have questions

## Notes
- Feel free to make reasonable assumptions where requirements are ambiguous
- Document any assumptions made
- Prioritize maintainable, production-ready code over quick solutions
