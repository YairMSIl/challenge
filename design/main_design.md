# Design elements and considerations

## System Architecture

### Components
1. Core Service Manager
   - Request routing # TODO: Explicit user intent with tags like "/image bla bla bla" or implicit LLM intent recognition with agent-like framework
   - Response formatting # Need to properly format output image/audio and decide on how present the research
   - Cost tracking integration # Track API calls to external resources and compare with config that hosts the cost for each API to calculate $ cost

2. Service Modules
   - Image Generation Service
   - Music Generation Service
   - Research Generation Service
   - Each implements common interface for uniformity  # Most likely a 'Tool' interface from smolagents lib

3. Cost Management System
   - Real-time cost tracking

## API Integration

### Image Generation
- Try free Gemini 2.0 flash

### Music Generation
- Primary: Mubert API
- Considerations:
  - Audio format compatibility

### Research Generation
- Primary: Gemini 2.0 flash

## Cost Tracking

### Implementation
- JSON configuration file for API costs:
```json
{
  "dalle": {
    "image_generation": {
      "1024x1024": 0.020,
      "512x512": 0.018
    }
  },
  "gpt4": {
    "input_tokens": 0.03,
    "output_tokens": 0.06
  }
}
```
- Real-time cost calculation
- Per-session and historical tracking

## UI

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: React-based Chatbot UI
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- File handling through REST 
- smolagents framework for the agents (https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)
- uv for environment setup

### Features
- Multi-modal chat interface
- File upload/download support
- Cost display per message
- Session management
- Response streaming
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Deployment

### Container Setup
- Multi-stage Dockerfile
- Environment configuration
- Volume mapping for persistent data

### Direct Execution
- Virtual environment setup
- Dependencies management
- Configuration file handling

### Scripts
```bash
/scripts
  ├── setup.sh        # Environment setup
  ├── run_local.sh    # Direct execution
  ├── run_docker.sh   # Container execution
  └── test.sh        # Test suite execution
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Request Processing
1. Input Analysis
   - Command-based ("/image", "/music", "/research")
   - Natural language understanding for implicit requests
   - Context maintenance

2. Service Selection
   - Rule-based routing
   - Service availability checking
   - Load balancing if needed

3. Response Handling
   - Format standardization
   - Error handling
   - Cost calculation
   - Response streaming

### Data Flow
1. User Input → Request Parser
2. Parser → Service Router
3. Router → Appropriate Service
4. Service → Cost Tracker
5. Service → Response Formatter
6. Formatted Response → UI

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests for API interactions
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Cost tracking accuracy tests
- Performance benchmarking

## Monitoring and Logging
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Cost monitoring
- Performance metrics
- API usage statistics

## Security Considerations
- API key management
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Content filtering
- User session management
```

Decisions to take later:

1. Maximum budget per user session?
2. Required response time SLAs?
3. Expected concurrent user load?
4. Data retention requirements?
5. Specific API versions to support?
